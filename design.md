**Design Explanation**
To solve this problem I used an assortment of JSONArrays and loops to write out all entries based on the given parameters which were a keyword and a k value. I would first the entries that had an title with the keyword in it and then parse through the citations from 0 to k.
I would iterate through each citation entry and then find the appropriate information for the entry and then subsequently write it to an output file.
